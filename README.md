# Diabetes
Using Jupyter Notebook to clean, visulaize and predict diabetes outcome

I have a real interest in chronic diseases for both professional and personal reasons, and I wanted to play around with some real world data to work and improve upon some of my python skills, so I started by downloading the data from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), but have it loaded on Github for easy download along with my python notbook file

I then opened my Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator and imported the relevant libraries I would be working with:

  import pandas as pd #data processing
  import numpy as np #linear alegebra                        
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #plotting
  import seaborn as sns #statistical data visualization
  
  I then read the data into a dataframe and looked at the head and tail data (first 5 observations and final 5 obeservations) to see what I was working with
  I wanted to play around with some other ways to though the data, so I also displayed a random sample of 10 records
  
  Next, I wanted to check out the number of observations and the comun types and name
